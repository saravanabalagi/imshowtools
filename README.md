# imshowtools

This library lets you view images in Jupyter notebooks in a much simpler and intuitive way. Ships with a better 'imshow' function with Multi Images, Smart Wrap and BGR support!.

## Installation

To install imshowtools,

```python
pip install imshowtools
```

## Usage

Open a jupyter notebook and use imshowtools as shown below:

#### Show a Single Image
```python
from imshowtools import *
imshow(your_image)
```

#### Show Multiple Images
```python
from imshowtools import *
imshow(image_1, image_2, image_3)
```

#### Show Multiple Images from Array
```python
from imshowtools import *
imshow(*my_image_array)
```

#### Smart Wrapping / Custom Rows and Columns
We choose the right layout for you:

* Have 6 images? You get 2x3
* Have 12 images? You get 3x4

You can also choose to manually control how many rows and columns you
```python
from imshowtools import *
imshow(*my_image_array, rows=3, columns=4)
```

#### BGR Colorspace

OpenCV lover? `imshowtools` can also handle `cv2`'s BGR images
```python
from imshowtools import *
import cv2

cv2image = cv2.imread('my_image.png')
imshow(cv2image, mode='BGR')
```

#### Namespaces
If you do not want to use `imshow` directly in your app (maybe you have another function named imshow), you shall use it like

```python
import imshowtools
imshowtools.imshow(your_image)
```

or if you like to use a custom namespace
```python
import imshowtools as my_namespace
my_namespace.imshow(your_image)
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall `imshowtools`,

```python
pip uninstall imshowtools
```
